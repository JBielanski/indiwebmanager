# INDI Web Manager

INDI Web Manager is a simple Web Application to manage [INDI](http://www.indilib.org) server. It supports multiple driver profiles along with optional custom remote drivers. It can be used to start INDI server locally, and also to connect or **chain** to remote INDI servers.

# Installation

INDI Library must be installed on the target system. The Web Application is based on [Bottle Py](http://bottlepy.org) micro-framework. It has a built-in webserver and by default listens on port 8624. Install the pre-requisites:

```
$ sudo apt-get -y install python-requests python-psutil python-bottle
```

Copy the **servermanager** folder to your home directory $(HOME) or any folder where the user has read and write access.

# Usage

The INDI Web Manager can run as a standalone server. It can be started manually by invoking python:

```
$ cd servermanager
$ python drivermanager.py
```

Then using your favorite web browser, go to http://localhost:8624 if the INDI Web Manager is running locally. If the INDI Web Manager is installed on a remote system, simply replace localhost with the hostname or IP address of the remote system.

# Auto Start

To enable the INDI Web Manager to automatically start after a system reboot, a systemd service file is provided for your convenience:

```
[Unit]
Description=INDI Web Manager
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=idle
User=pi
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python /home/pi/servermanager/drivermanager.py
ExecStartPost=/usr/bin/python /home/pi/servermanager/autostart.py
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

The above service files assumes you copied the servermanager directory to /home/pi, so change it to whereever you installed the directory on your target system. The user is also specified as **pi** and must be changed to your username.

If you selected any profile as **Auto Start** then the INDI server shall be automatically started when the service is executed on start up.

Copy the indiwebmanager.service file to **/lib/systemd/system**:

```
sudo cp indiwebmanager.service /lib/systemd/system/
sudo chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/indiwebmanager.service
```

Now configure systemd to load the service file during boot:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable indiwebmanager.service
```

Finally, reboot the system for your changes to take effect:

```
sudo reboot
```

After startup, check the status of the INDI Web Manager service:

```
sudo systemctl status indiwebmanager.service
```

If all appears OK, you can start using the Web Application using any browser.

# Profiles

The Web Application provides a default profile to run simulator drivers. To use a new profile, add the profile name and then click  the plus button. Next, select which drivers to run under this particular profile. After selecting the drivers, click the **Save** icon to save all your changes. To enable automatic startup of INDI server for a particular profile when the device boots up or when invoked manually via the **systemctl** command, check the **Auto Start** checkbox.

# API

INDI Web Manager provides a RESTful API to control all aspects of the application. Data communication is via JSON messages. All URLs are appended to the hostname:port running the INDI Web Manager.
